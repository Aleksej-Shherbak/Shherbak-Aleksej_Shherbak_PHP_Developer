## MY STRENGTHS
I do not shift my job to someone else. If I have a problem, and I can't solve it, and it's clear that
my colleagues is unlikely to answer me right away, I'd better go to Stackoverflow and ask.
In addition to programming, I like music, play guitar in a band. I try to develop
comprehensively and not be a "troglodyte", shielded from the whole world by a wall of monitors.
